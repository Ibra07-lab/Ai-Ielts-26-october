CRITICAL DISTINCTION: FALSE vs NOT GIVEN
============================================================

FALSE:
  • The passage ADDRESSES the topic and says the OPPOSITE
  • There IS information, but it CONTRADICTS
  • You CAN quote conflicting text

NOT GIVEN:

TWO-QUESTION TEST:
Step 1: Does the passage discuss this topic/make a related claim?
  → If YES: Go to Question 2
  → If NO: Answer is NOT GIVEN
Step 2: Does the passage AGREE or CONTRADICT?
  → If AGREES: Answer is TRUE
  → If CONTRADICTS: Answer is FALSE

CRITICAL SIGNAL WORDS
============================================================

Qualifiers (Often Create FALSE Traps):
  • "some students" → "all students" = FALSE - Scope changed
  • "often occurs" → "always occurs" = FALSE - Frequency changed
  • "may cause" → "definitely causes" = FALSE - Certainty changed
  • "one of the reasons" → "the main reason" = FALSE/NOT GIVEN - Importance changed
  • "rarely happens" → "never happens" = FALSE - Absolute vs qualified

Comparatives & Superlatives:
  • "larger than X" → "smaller than X" = FALSE
  • "the largest" → "one of the largest" = Could be TRUE
  • "more popular" → "most popular" = NOT GIVEN unless confirmed

Time & Sequence Words:
  • "before 1990" → "after 1990" = FALSE
  • "since 2010" → "prior to 2010" = FALSE
  • "X then Y" → "Y then X" = FALSE - Order matters

TOP 5 COMMON MISTAKES
============================================================

1. Using Outside Knowledge
   Trap: You know something is true in real life, so you mark it TRUE.
   Rule: Only use information IN the passage. Your knowledge is irrelevant.
   ❌ Wrong: I know CO2 is a greenhouse gas, so TRUE.
   ✓ Correct: The passage doesn't mention CO2 at all → NOT GIVEN

2. Confusing FALSE and NOT GIVEN
   Trap: The statement seems wrong, so you choose FALSE—but the passage never discusses it.
   Rule: FALSE needs a contradiction. No information = NOT GIVEN.
   ❌ Wrong: 50 participants sounds expensive, but the passage doesn't say it was expensive, so FALSE.
   ✓ Correct: Cost is never mentioned → NOT GIVEN

3. Over-Inferencing for TRUE
   Trap: You make a logical assumption and treat it as confirmed.
   Rule: TRUE requires explicit support, not logical assumptions.
   ❌ Wrong: Why would they expand if not for profit? TRUE.
   ✓ Correct: Profitability expectations are never stated → NOT GIVEN

4. Missing Paraphrases
   Trap: You don't recognize that the passage says the same thing differently.
   Rule: Learn to recognize synonyms and paraphrases.
   ❌ Wrong: I can't find the words 'inhabitants' or 'fell' → NOT GIVEN.
   ✓ Correct: 'population' = 'number of inhabitants'; 'declined rapidly' = 'fell quickly' → TRUE

5. Ignoring Qualifiers
   Trap: You miss small words that change meaning significantly.

5-STEP STRATEGY
============================================================

Step 1: Read the Statement Carefully
  Identify the KEY CLAIM being made. Note specific details: names, numbers, dates, qualifiers. Underline critical words.

Step 2: Locate the Relevant Section
  Statements usually follow passage order. Scan for keywords or synonyms. Find the 1-3 sentences that discuss this topic.

Step 3: Compare Precisely
  Read the relevant passage section carefully. Compare each element against the passage. Pay attention to qualifiers, scope, degree, and time references.

Step 4: Apply the Three-Way Test
  Can I find text that CONFIRMS this? → TRUE | Can I find text that CONTRADICTS this? → FALSE | Can I find NO relevant information? → NOT GIVEN

Step 5: Verify Your Answer
  For TRUE: Can I quote supporting evidence? For FALSE: Can I quote contradicting evidence? For NOT GIVEN: Am I certain this isn't addressed anywhere?
