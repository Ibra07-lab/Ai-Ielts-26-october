  "passage": "The Industrial Revolution, which began in Britain in the late 18th century, marked a major turning point in human history. Previous to this period, manufacturing was often done in people's homes, using hand tools or basic machines. The Industrial Revolution introduced new manufacturing processes, including the transition to new chemical manufacturing and iron production processes, the increasing use of steam power and water power, the development of machine tools and the rise of the mechanized factory system. The revolution also brought about a massive increase in population and urbanization, as people moved from rural areas to cities in search of factory work. This transformation had profound effects on economic, social, and cultural conditions, fundamentally changing the way people lived and worked. The textile industry was one of the first to adopt these new methods, with innovations such as the spinning jenny and the power loom dramatically increasing production capacity. While the Industrial Revolution brought economic growth and technological advancement, it also created new social problems, including poor working conditions in factories, child labor, and increased pollution in industrial cities.",
