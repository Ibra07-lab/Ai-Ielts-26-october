        "passage": "Online learning has transformed education dramatically over the past five years. A 2023 study by the Education Research Institute found that 78% of university students now take at least one online course during their degree. The flexibility of online learning appeals particularly to working adults, who represent 45% of all online learners. However, critics argue that online education lacks the social interaction necessary for developing communication skills. Professor Sarah Chen from Melbourne University believes that blended learning - combining online and face-to-face instruction - offers the best solution. She conducted research with 200 students in 2022 and found that those in blended programs showed 25% better engagement scores compared to purely online courses. Despite these benefits, technical difficulties remain a significant challenge, with 30% of students reporting connectivity issues during live sessions.",

While the technology has improved dramatically over the past decade, with battery range now exceeding 300 miles for most models, the high purchase price remains a significant barrier for average consumers. Government incentives have helped in some markets, particularly in Norway, where EVs now account for over 50% of new car sales. However, in countries without such subsidies, adoption rates remain below 5%. Industry analysts believe that prices must fall by at least 30% before EVs become mainstream in these markets.",
