        "passage": "Online learning has transformed education dramatically over the past five years. A 2023 study by the Education Research Institute found that 78% of university students now take at least one online course during their degree. The flexibility of online learning appeals particularly to working adults, who represent 45% of all online learners. However, critics argue that online education lacks the social interaction necessary for developing communication skills. Professor Sarah Chen from Melbourne University believes that blended learning - combining online and face-to-face instruction - offers the best solution. She conducted research with 200 students in 2022 and found that those in blended programs showed 25% better engagement scores compared to purely online courses. Despite these benefits, technical difficulties remain a significant challenge, with 30% of students reporting connectivity issues during live sessions.",

It wasn't until the Industrial Revolution brought iron and steel that engineers could span great distances.",
