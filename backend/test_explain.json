  "passage": "The Arctic is experiencing unprecedented changes due to climate change. Scientists have observed that the region is warming at twice the rate of the global average, a phenomenon known as Arctic amplification. This rapid warming has led to significant reductions in sea ice extent, with September sea ice (the annual minimum) declining at a rate of about 13% per decade since the late 1970s. The loss of sea ice has profound implications for Arctic ecosystems, indigenous communities, and global climate patterns.",
